100 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code Challenge! This journey is all about consistency, growth, and sharing what I learn every day.

The main goal is to code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. I'll document my progress, challenges, and breakthroughs along the way.

I take on this challenge of improving my coding skills day by day and be consistent in my work.
